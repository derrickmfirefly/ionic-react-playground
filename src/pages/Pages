PAGES:

This directory should only contain full page content views.
NO logic should exist in the page files. Logic for pages should reside in the components the page loads, or the features it loads.

Examples: HomePage, LightsPage, TodoPage, etc...

Components on Pages:

1) if component is used ONLY on one page, place component in '/ pages / [page_name] / [component_name].js'
2) if component is used on MULTIPLE pages, place component in '/ components / [component_name] / [component_name].js'
