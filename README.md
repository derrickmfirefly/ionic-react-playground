# Ionic React Playground - READ THIS!!!

## Rules

Brief rules:
1) When adding new "features", add a new folder with all the files necessary for the feature
2) Feel free to mess with the UI and remove/add features and their UIs as you mess around. The idea is, develop features modularly enough so they can easily be added/removed without breaking anything :)
3) Follow the redux/toolkit guide on creating a new slice. Feel free to check out 'todoSlice.js' as an example. 
4) When messing around, make a new branch 'feature/NAME_OF_BRANCH'

## To Build changes

This is currently a web app. It is setup with Capacitor if you want to build it to a device, just run 'npm run syncDroid'
But, its easier to just run 'npm start' and edit the devtools window to display a phone type :)
